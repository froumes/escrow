//! Flip-intake diagnostics — answers "why am I not getting flips?".
//!
//! The COFL websocket loop in `main.rs` applies a series of gates to every
//! incoming AH flip (AH flips disabled, intake paused, Coflnet not yet
//! authenticated, startup still running, inventory full, …). Each of those
//! gates used to `continue` at `debug!` level, so a bot that silently dropped
//! every flip looked perfectly healthy on the default INFO log and in the
//! panel. This tracker records the drops, surfaces the reason in the web panel
//! and the `/ping` command, and logs a throttled, VISIBLE line so the operator
//! can see what is happening without drowning in per-flip spam.
